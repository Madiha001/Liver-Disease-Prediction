# Liver-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a patient has liver disease or not based on various medical attributes.
The project begins by importing necessary Python libraries and reading in the Indian Liver Patient Dataset.
Data preprocessing is then performed, including conversion of nominal attributes to discrete and filling in missing values with zeros.
Data visualization is done through box plots, histograms, and scatter plots to gain insights into the data.
The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier is used to build a model to predict liver disease. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, MCC, F-measure, and AUROC.
Overall, this project provides an example of how data preprocessing and KNN can be used to predict whether a patient has liver disease or not.
